# Cleaning-and-Transforming-Data-using-R

For my current work, I am **automating the entire data cleaning and transforming process using the R programming language**. An entirely new data from the same system can be cleaned and transformed automatically using this code. I have uploaded some of my code.

Steps Performed for cleansing are:
1. Merge multiple datasets for visualizations
2. Deleting rows and columns
3. Working on date and timestamps and transforming them to a new format
4. Removing ID numbers
5. Dealing with decimal values
6. Getting rid of a particular type of status data
7. Replacing NA values
8. Creating multiple new columns
9. Using if-else statements for working on data conditions
10. Removing duplicates
11. Replacing negative values
